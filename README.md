# HiTag Android

Done by: Team RODS

Minimum Android Version: 4.3
Requirements: Razer Nabu (Any Version)

This is a project done for the Razer Nabu Challenge. No Copyright is made or infringed for this git.

HiTag is a game based on the once popular tag game. With wearable technology slowly becoming the norm, we are creating new ways
to integrate this technology with the traditional games we once play. Using the Razer Nabu's Hi5 Technology, we are able to
recreate the tag game and hopefully revive the once popular game among friends.

We are not part of Razer in anyway. However, we are utilising the open-source NabuSDK provided by Razer to create the application for the Razer Nabu.
